Our goal is to accelerate the development of React-based web applications, especially front-end integrations.

We created Clapy because, as developers, we know how time consuming pixel-perfecting a UI is, while there is so much more to code in a web app. What's worse than slowly translating a Figma file to code with 3 screens? Figma for reference, the IDE to code and the browser to preview? ðŸ™„



With its developer-centric features, Clapy can be used for following use cases:

1. Kickstart a web app from Figma
2. Automate your Design System management
